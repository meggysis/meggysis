Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! My username is **@Meggysis**, but my name is Meg Sissel. I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and goals with the GitHub community! Feel free to explore my projects and learn more about my passion for software engineering.

## A Little About Me ><(((ยบ>

I am a senior Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering. Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong passion for applying software engineering principles to various fields, including medical engineering and truck programming. My journey in tech has been fueled by a desire to create impactful solutions and continuously expand my knowledge.

## Projects I've Worked On 

Here are some of the projects I've been involved in:

- **Daycare Website**: Developed a user-friendly website for a daycare center, focusing on ease of use for parents and staff. Utilized technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant tools. I currently have a repository containing some files from this project.
  
- **Bioinformatics Project**: Worked on coding the genome of a fruit fly and generating diagnostic charts in PDF format using Linux. This project allowed me to explore the intersection of biology and software engineering, sharpening my skills in both fields. (Note: This project is not public on GitHub due to privacy factors.)

- **Case Management App Project**: Created an internal app for managing case files related to trucks being serviced or worked on, including tracking their status with the management team. The app also handles employee attendance and flags issues on their hourly calendar. (Note: This project is internal and not public on GitHub.)
